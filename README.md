### Markdown

To mark-up your content, write in Markdown. We use the 'kramdown' (default) markdown parser, which provides a couple of extra features. For a reference on what's possible see the [kramdown quick reference](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

## Developer information

This guide is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

### Setup

You would only **need** to do the following if you are a developer. If you are a content editor you can access and editing content for the guide directly via GitHub. However, it can be nice having the guide locally to work and preview --- feel free to ask a developer if you would like to set up a local instance of the guide.

### Requirements

- Ruby
- Jekyll

We also pull in the 1.x version of the [UI-Kit](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-ui-kit) as a submodule.

We will likely change this, and instead package up everything needed to produce a new guide scaffold as a Ruby gem for Jekyll to consume.

Setup locally

```
git clone git@github.com:govau/content-guide.git 
cd content-guide
git submodule init
git submodule update
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Launch locally

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you get gem errors, try

```
rbenv rehash
```

If you still have troubles ask for help! (:

### Broken link testing

Internal links are tested as part of the CI build pipeline in `bin/citest.sh`, however to keep test results reproducible external links are skipped.

You should periodically manually test external links with:

`bin/checkexternal.sh`
